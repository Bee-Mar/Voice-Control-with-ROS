# Project Overview

Using ROS, a TurtleBot was programmed in Python to respond to voice commands
issued by the user. Aside from ROS, the PocketSphinx library was used to
generate language files from the corpus used for this project. Aside from
responding to raw commands (ie. "turn left"), the robot could also navigate to
particular portions of the map, given the proper voice commands. A demonstration
of the project can be seen at the link below.
